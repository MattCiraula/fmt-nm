Clojure program for changing file names to kebab-case

I have a passion for kebab-case, especially when it comes to files on my system. This allows me to quickly type paths without having to hit that pesky shift key. This isn't a typical use-case for clojure, but I want to practice my clojure skills and compiling clojure to a native binary using GraalVM.
